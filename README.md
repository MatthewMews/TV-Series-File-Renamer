## Instructions

2.	Copy the directory path the files are location in and paste the path into the console. Click the enter key on your keyboard to continue.
3.	The program will now check the directory exists. If the directory exists you can move onto the next step, otherwise you will need to enter a valid directory path.
4.	(Optional) You are given the option to rename the directory folder. If you chose to do so, enter ‘y’ or ‘yes’ into the application window, and enter the directory’s new name.
5.	The program will now detect valid video files within the directory. Enter the episodes title based on the information provided (series & episode number) and click enter. It will now move onto the next video file until all the episodes have been named.

In the event the program is unable to detect the series or episode name, you will be given the option to enter it manually.
